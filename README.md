# python_voice_assistant
 A voice assistant developed in python with Pyside6 and Qml

This application is not optimized and is not intended for production use, it is a piece of software I designed to measure the scope of what I could do with Python and Pyside. 

The asynchronous functionality requires Multithreading, coroutines and futures in Python give me headaches, I tried to figure it out for months without success so I used the easy way out. With the Python threading package, I can use multiple processes and also use events to handle everything.

Feature:
- Give date
- Give the day
- Give the time
- Take screenshots
- Keep information
- Searches Wikipedia (returns only the first 5 sentences)
- Opens the link to its GitHub repository
- Performs string to binary conversions
- The application introduces itself and says who it is
- Turns off the computer (not deployed)
- Restarts the computer (not deployed)
- Logs out of the session (Not deployed)
- Find and start a file (Not deployed)
